# Agentica

Agentica is a curated collection of LLM agents I've built over time—ranging from slick daily utilities to wild proofs of concept. Each agent is modular, purpose-driven, and a little rebellious in its own way.

## Current Agents

### Memorable
Memorable is your on-demand memory enhancer. It logs your interactions, recalls context with near psychic precision, and helps you navigate complex conversations without missing a beat.  
*Status: Stable & evolving*

### Tool Builder
A specific agent used to create specific tools (api, programs) to enhance the capabilities of other agents.

<!-- Add details about other agents below as they’re added -->

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Brilliance:** Harnessing the latest in large language models for smart, contextual responses.
- **Modular Architecture:** Plug-and-play design lets you integrate or experiment with individual agents.
- **Real-World Utility:** From daily reminders to deep-dive research, these agents are built to perform.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joey-david/agentica.git
   cd agentica
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure as Needed:**  
   Each agent has its own settings file. Check the individual READMEs for specifics.

## Usage

Run your favorite agent directly from the command line. For example, to launch Memorable:
```bash
python memorable.py
```
Each agent comes with its own documentation detailing commands, options, and examples.


## Roadmap

- **Expand Agent Library:** New agents and enhancements are always in the pipeline.
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** CLI, mobile notifications, and more.
- **Continuous Learning:** Integrate feedback loops for agents to evolve over time.
