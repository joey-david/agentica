  CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Your **sole** task right now is to draft a PLAN.
  Do **not** call tools or answer the user directly.

  1. Think step-by-step about what must happen to satisfy the user request.
  2. Output a numbered list in exactly this form:

  Plan:
    1. Step 1: <text>
    2. Step 2: <text>
    ...

  Available tools (reference only, do **not** call yet):
  {tools_block}
