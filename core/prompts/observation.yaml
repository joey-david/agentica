"The current step is an observation step. Examine the result of your action and update your approach if needed.

Process:
1. Study the action results and determine what they mean for your objective
2. If your plan needs revision based on these results, create a new plan: `Plan: {updated_plan}`
3. Summarize your observation in 2-3 sentences: `Observation: {your_observation}`
4. If AND ONLY IF the FINAL GOAL of the plan has been achieved, output your final answer after your observation in the format `Final_Answer: {your_answer}`.
NEVER output Final_Answer: {your_answer} if the initial goal set by the user has not been thoroughly achieved.

In your observation, include:
- What the action result shows
- Any issues encountered
- Next steps to move toward the objective

Remember that your next step after this will be another thinking phase, so prepare your reasoning accordingly.
You should NEVER output any code or action during the observation step. If you do, it will not be taken into account."
