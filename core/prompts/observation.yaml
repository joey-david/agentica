"The current step is an observation step. Examine the result of your action and update your approach if needed.

Process:
1. Study the action results and determine what they mean for your objective
2. If your plan needs revision based on these results, create a new plan: `Plan: {updated_plan}`
3. Summarize your observation in 2-3 sentences: `Observation: {your_observation}`
4. If AND ONLY IF the FINAL GOAL of the plan has been achieved, output your final answer after your observation in the format `Final_Answer: {your_answer}`.


In your observation, include:
- What the action result shows
- Any issues encountered
- Next steps to move toward the objective

Remember that your next step after this will be another thinking phase, so prepare your reasoning accordingly."
