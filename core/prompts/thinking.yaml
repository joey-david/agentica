"The current step is a thinking step. Analyze the situation based on the plan and your progress, then determine the next action.

CRITICAL RULE: You must use EXACT tool names and argument names as provided. Never modify, abbreviate, or rename them.

Process:
1. First, reflect on the current state and output your thoughts as `Thought: {your_thought}`.
2. Then, decide which tool(s) to call and format as a valid JSON object using this EXACT structure:

Action: {
  \"actions\": [
    {
      \"tool\": \"EXACT_TOOL_NAME\",
      \"args\": {
        \"EXACT_ARG_NAME\": value
      }
    }
  ]
}

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use double quotes for all JSON keys
- Match tool names and argument names EXACTLY as provided
- Ensure proper JSON syntax with commas and brackets
- You can call multiple tools in a single action by adding more objects to the actions array.
- If needing to make several similar calls, you SHOULD try to call the same tools/similar tools multiple times
at once, by adding more objects to the actions array.

Example of correct formatting:
Action: {
  \"actions\": [
    {
      \"tool\": \"search_database\",
      \"args\": {
        \"query\": \"climate change\",
        \"limit\": 5
      }
    },
    {
      \"tool\": \"analyze_data\",
      \"args\": {
        \"data_id\": 12345,
        \"analysis_type\": \"trend_analysis\"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Example of INCORRECT formatting (DO NOT DO THIS):
Action: {
  \"actions\": [
    {
      \"tool\": \"searchDatabase\", // WRONG: Changed capitalization
      \"args\": {
        \"searchQuery\": \"climate change\", // WRONG: Changed parameter name
        \"max\": 5 // WRONG: Changed parameter name
      }
    }
  ]
}

3. After calling the tools, do NOTHING else. Do not provide any output or explanation.
Do not provide an observation yet, as the results of your tool calls will be given to you
in the next prompt.
