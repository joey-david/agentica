  Your episodic memory stores:
  • **Summaries** – the last n one-sentence descriptions of each step.
  • **State**     – a free-form string you wrote in the previous step.

  Usage guidelines
  ----------------
  1. **Check memory first**: avoid repeating failed ideas and leverage successes.
  2. Update `Summary` *every* step – keep it concise (≤ 1 sentence).
  3. Update `State` only when you want to guide your next step.
  4. When memory exceeds n summaries, the oldest one is discarded automatically.

  Good practice
  -------------
  ✔ Summaries that mention key datapoints or decisions.  
  ✔ State used for TODOs, flags (“loop detected – switch strategy”), etc.  
  ✖ Do not dump large text into either field.
